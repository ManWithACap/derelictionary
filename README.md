## About
**Derelictionary** is a Python script  run in a terminal. It functions as a database of information on things such as:
> **Trading Posts**

> **Outposts**

> **Stargates**

> **Galaxies**

> **Systems**

Each of these info nodes can be searched through by a variety of methods and keywords. When data is found, it is reported to the user along with any other information about the object that was searched. I'll refer to it as an app from now on even though it's really just more of a script.
This app is developed by only myself with much love for the great game that is Duskers. Down below I'll explain further on how to use the program and provide screenshots of what it looks like. If you would like to help in creating this app, I'd love to put you on the team! Shoot me a message either here or on Discord @ aamorphous.
